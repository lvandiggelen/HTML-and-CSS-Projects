         Hello, my name is DJ Lewis. I want to make your next event, One To Remember! <br>

I do not scratch. I just play the best music tailored to your event. My passion for music developed at the end of High School when I attended my first General Admission concert and I got to see Swedish House Mafia on their last tour. I walked into the event teeming with excitement. I walked out sold to the love of music. Through college I grew this love by becoming a DJ.<br>

My roommates and I had a lot of parties and before I started mixing, and we would have our DJ friend Quentin perform. The only problem was that he would always play heavy electronic music that did not appeal to most of the crowd. There came a point when we needed a change, so I stepped to the plate. Before long I was behind the turntables playing the songs everyone was asking for. The one thing I have enjoyed most about being a DJ is reading the audience and catering the music to what they desire. I am constantly asked, “What music do you play at your events?” and my consistent answer is, “I play what the crowd wants to hear.” I started in 2015, and since then I have grown my skills and expanded my setup. My first gigs were at friends’ parties, but I quickly expanded to playing for Fraternity date nights, college events, and downtown clubs. Since college I have played at many weddings, Bar & Bat Mitzvahs, Birthday parties, and School Dances. For two years I was the resident DJ for Almaden Country School. I always looked forward to playing exactly what excited those middle school kids most. If you would like, I could connect you with previous clients so you can hear first hand how fun my events are.
<br>
I am a young, jubilant DJ bursting with energy that I would love to bring to your next event. I am equipped for any situation. If you have any questions about me or my rates please feel free to call at (408) 931-0531 or send me an email at Lvandiggelen@gmail.com.<br> </p>

Lewis is awesome. He is very kind and a fun person to be around. He made sure we were 100% satisfied at all times. He is a very easy person to work with and he had great communication with us while planning our party. He showed up early and politely introduced himself. He exceeded our expectations and his price was great. He brought a lot of cool lights that made our party even better. We definitely reccomend him.

Lewis is professional, helpful, and fun! He DJ'd my daughter's sweet 16 and the kids had a blast! There is honestly not one bad thing I can say about this DJ!!!!!

Showed up early for set up and sound check and cleaned everything up. Was responsive to music requests. Came prepared and kept everyone amped up.

We hired Lewis for our high school's winter formal and had an awesome experience with him! He showed up on time, was super responsive prior to the event, and brought all of the equipment needed and more. We will definitely hire again.

DJ Lewis brought exactly what he promised. We hired him to host our birthday party and he was awesome. Not only did he have a wide variety of music, but he knew to follow the energy of the party throughout the night. Additionally he was very easy to communicate with, open to suggestions, and very professional in all transactions. We would be glad to hire him again for our next event!

Lewis is a dream to work with, and we've had a dozen DJs at my school in the past 11 years, so I know. Lewis shows up early for setup and is very particular to make sure everything is "just right." He listens carefully to expectations (setup, behavior, hislanguage/tone, choice of music) and is incredibly respectful both in terms of the school's culture and the concerns of the chaperones/administration. He meets people well and professionally; he's polite, articulate, positive, and humble. He works VERY hard to please his employer, and HE PUTS ON A GREAT SHOW FOR THE KIDS!! He has games and activities they love, he knows how to get them moving and dancing and laughing, he picks music they love but that fits our age-appropriate parameters, and he is himself really fun and funny to watch with his whacky outfits and his "Magic Mirror." We've never had so many positive student comments about a DJ, including unanimous requests to bring one back for the next dance, as we routinely have for Lewis. After every event, I can count on a group of kids approaching me to make sure Lewis will DJ the next dance. And on top of it all, Lewis van Diggelen is a really nice, big-hearted young man. I give him my highest recommendation, without reservation.

I found Lewis by way of my family friend helping me with my wedding. I was planning my wedding out of state and she found him for me. The price was right. Then we spoke on the phone and he was super laid back/chill, easy to talk to. Finally met the week of my wedding and he was very sweet and professional. Everyone had a good time with the music choices he made and mixed my songs in along with. His timing with my walking music down the isle was perfect.

Lewis was amazing! We had him DJ our wedding, and he did a great job! He also stepped up to help MC at the last minute and was so personable! He showed up early, was super helpful, and enthusiastic. He went above an beyond, even drafting a script for the MCing! Lewis is professional, always made sure to check in and see if we needed anything, and made himself available for questions. Our Day of Coordinator also loved working with Lewis. And he did an amazing job DJing! Highly recommend!

Lewis made our party really fun with his exceptional DJ skills. He was open to suggestions and type of music that we wanted.

Lewis did a great job at my son's birthday. The kids loved this mirror optical illusion prop he brought and he did a good job with the song choices. It was great that he had all the equipment he needed so we didn't need to rent it from the venue. Overall he was great to work with and we would highly recommend him for an event!

Lewis was amazing to work with. During calls you could see the professionalism he had and he was very open to any adjustments we needed. He also made a demo of his music in less than a day which was amazing. Lewis also had a great setup and he let us use many light for free which was a lifesaver. Through this whole hiring and working process you could really see his passion for music which made me want to hire in even more. I would definitely want to hire him again.

I can’t say enough about Lewis! He did an amazing job at my daughters sweet 16th. Kept the party going- no one wanted to leave. Totally professional and a joy to work with. Hire him!! You won’t be disappointed!

Lewis and his crew did a great job as a dj for us. They were very helpful and responsive to our guest request for music. Lewis was really easy to work with and even started early upon our request. I would definately hire him again and recommend him to family and friends! Thank you Lewis for your hard work!!

Lewis was a great DJ for my school. He arrived early and was professional throughout. His pricing was excellent. He was very energetic, and got the students dancing. Overall, he was a strong DJ and we'll most likely ask him to DJ again.
